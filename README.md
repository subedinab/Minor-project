# Crash detection system

This project aims to develop a crash detection system using a SIM600L GPS module and an accelerometer. The system will be able to detect vehicular crashes and send an alert to a designated contact.

## System components

* SIM600L GPS module
* Accelerometer
* Microcontroller
* Cellular modem
* Antenna

## System operation

The SIM600L GPS module will be used to determine the vehicle's location. The accelerometer will be used to detect sudden changes in acceleration. The microcontroller will be used to process data from the GPS module and accelerometer. The cellular modem will be used to send alerts to designated contacts.

The microcontroller will continuously monitor the accelerometer for sudden changes in acceleration. If the microcontroller detects a change in acceleration that is consistent with a crash, it will record the vehicle's location and time of the crash. The microcontroller will then send an alert to a designated contact. The alert will include the vehicle's location, time of the crash, and a link to a map showing the crash location.

## Conclusion

The crash detection system has the potential to improve driver safety by providing a quick and easy way to notify emergency services in the event of a crash. The system can also be used to track vehicle movements and provide insights into driver behavior.
